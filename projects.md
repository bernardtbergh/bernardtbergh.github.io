# Project ideas:
1. Design and build DC variable load device
1. Design and build VSD - multiphase sine wave simulator
1. Develop a multi-purpose automation product for various industries enabling simple end-user setup and SCADA system for any simple automation applications
1. Design and build an efficient Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (for 1kW or so)
1. Design and 3D print / cast a supersonic rocket nozzle
1. Design and build an independently driven wheel hybrid 4x4 from scratch (road legal) - requires a lot of tooling for turning, milling, CNC cutting, casting, and heat-treatment - not realistic, but a multi-year project dream
1. Investigate SOFC - cheap build - efficiency compromise
1. Flow meter using only power and frequency values of a pump (VSD) - simple to calibrate
